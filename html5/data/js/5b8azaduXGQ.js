Benefit - provides a quick resolution\\n   3. Downsides - Tends to negatively affect a relationship\\n\\nAvoiding the Conflict\\n  1. Instead of confronting the issue the person just refuses to acknowledge it\\n  2. Works well in the short term or when the issue itself is trivial. Does not work well long \\n       term or in most team dynamics\\n  3. Benefit - buys time to better prepare for confronting the conflict\\n  4. Downsides - can affect relationships, can be mistaken as a form of consent.\\n\\nAccommodating Others\\n  1. When someone does not speak up to voice their needs or thoughts on an issue\\n  2. Benefit - when used with issues that are trivial or minor can prevent an immediate \\n       conflict\\n  3. Downsides - Repetitive use generally leads to the person who is accommodating \\n      feeling frustrated, difficult to change to more effective strategy\\n\\nCompromising to Create a Solution\\n   1. Involves everyone involved working together to create a workable solution where\\n       everyone gets something that they want but have to give up something else that they\\n       want\\n   2. Benefit - useful when deciding important issues and time is a factor\\n   3. Downside - can strain relationships, may need to be monitored to make sure agreed-\\n       upon solution being adhered to\\n\\nCollaborating to Find a Solution\\n   1. All people involved share all of their needs, care about meeting the other peopleâ€™s\\n       needs, and work together to find a solution.\\n   2. Benefit - Builds long term relationships, everyone wins\\n   3. Downsides - Requires full cooperation from everyone involved at all times, takes a \\n       long time to achieve","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":128}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":412,"height":478,"strokewidth":0}},"width":412,"height":478,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"5aSJlQvCgYb"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","animations":[{"kind":"animation","id":"66ropwZghnY","duration":250,"hidetextatstart":true,"animateshapewithtext":false,"tweens":[{"kind":"tween","time":0,"duration":250,"alpha":{"path":[{"kind":"segment","start":"0","dstart":"0","end":"100","dend":"0"}],"duration":250,"easing":"linear","easingdir":"easein"}}]}],"useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
